# UMDK-SE: The Ultimate Malware Development Kit for Space Engineers

## Overview
**UMDK-SE (Ultimate Malware Development Kit for Space Engineers)** is an enhanced toolkit that takes the foundations of MDK²-SE to the next level. Building on the core functionality, UMDK-SE expands capabilities and introduces new features to make it the ultimate toolkit for Space Engineers’ in-game script (programmable block) development. With this powerful, all-in-one tool, developers can seamlessly design, test, optimize, and deploy scripts for Space Engineers with far greater efficiency and flexibility.

## Features and Capabilities

- **Automated Project Setup:** UMDK-SE creates a fully integrated script project in Visual Studio with all references in place. The intuitive setup wizard auto-detects common libraries and settings tailored to each user's needs.

- **Advanced Code Analyzer with Customizable Rulesets:** The improved analyzer identifies restricted code within Space Engineers more precisely and allows custom rule sets, so users can tailor the analyzer based on specific use cases or game mod requirements. Custom plugins for specialized checks are also supported.

- **In-Depth Performance Profiler and Optimizer:** Analyzes scripts and highlights bottlenecks, providing clear diagnostics and suggestions for optimization to increase efficiency within Space Engineers' constraints.

- **Automated Code Minification with Optional Symbol Mapping:** Fit more code into programmable blocks while retaining readability options through an optional symbol map. The "smart minify" feature balances size reduction with code readability, even in heavily optimized scripts.

- **Library and Template Expansion:** UMDK-SE introduces an extended library of code templates, including advanced templates for automation, resource management, and combat-related scripts, supporting custom library modules for frequently used functions.

- **One-Click Deploy to Game or Workshop:** Instantly send scripts to the Workshop or load them directly into Space Engineers without needing to copy/paste, simplifying testing and updates.

- **Real-Time Debugger** (Beta): A real-time debugging feature to emulate programmable block behavior without needing Space Engineers open, making it easier to catch issues early.

- **Community Support and Contribution Framework:** Developed with community involvement at its core, the project includes a streamlined contribution system for suggesting features, reporting bugs, and sharing custom modules or plugins.

## Getting Started
The UMDK-SE Wiki provides a complete setup guide, covering everything from installation in various IDEs/editors to using the advanced debugging and profiling tools. Users can find sample scripts, community-developed libraries, and guides for creating efficient scripts.

## Contribution
While UMDK-SE is community-driven, contributions are carefully reviewed to ensure compatibility and maintain high standards. Contributions that expand functionality, especially in complex areas like mod support or custom analyzers, are particularly welcome.
